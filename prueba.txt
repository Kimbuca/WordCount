If there’s one word you will get used to seeing a lot as you
go through this Guide, it is this one: protocol. You will
see reference to networking protocols, internetworking protocols, high-level 
protocols, low-level protocols, protocol stacks, protocol suites,
sub-protocols, and so on. Clearly protocols are important, yet many reference
works and standards use the term over and over again without ever explaining it.
One reason for this may be because the term is somewhat vague and can have many meanings,
which can make it difficult to grasp.
